We had booked his tuk tuk services from 8th to 11th febNow coming to SarnathWe visited Sarnath on 9th and 11th, What an amazing place for my daughter to know about Indian history and Buddha;s histroryWe took help of a local guide which Raj arranged for Rs 200 and he joined us to all the nearby places in Sarnath(Dhamek Stupa,Thai temple,Chaukand stupa)I also bought the Tibetian Music Bowl and my wife bought some lovely handbags at a good bargained price( as opposed to normal trend of getting commision from them) which was helped by Raj . More than just a driver Raj was a great tourist guide too showing a  lot of temples like the Mani temple , Baba bhairav temple which are not mentioned in most of the blogs.He  took us to  all the places to try the  best delicacies  that was on my list.",Jan-24, Family

Overall Sarnath and its Buddhist temples were very interesting , however I would suggest to enjoy Varanasi ghats and atmospheric alleys rather than visiting its outskirts, as you will take loads of time to move around Varanasi traffic and it's not really worth it if you have limited time.Pappu703@yahoo.com is his e-mail im case you need to visit Sarnath and Varanasi like us.Thank you India ❤️",Feb-24, Friends

We were so excited to visit this Archaeological Buddhist site. The way of buying a ticket was either to do it online or you had to scan a QR for ticket payment. But as we were a tourist who had just arrived and we didn't have mobile data access (as Nepalese people are not allowed to buy a local sim card with a Nepalese passport, which is a shame) or UPI. So, we asked for an option but the guards suggested we pay 50-100 rupees per person extra to the local guy to enter. We didn't want to be part of this scamming technique to enter these heritage sites so we went up to cops sitting nearby to seek help as we really wanted to visit Sarnath. But, the cops sitting nearby defamed me when he got to know I was from Nepal. he not only me but my country Nepal and all the Nepalese. I cannot even publicly mention what he told me about my country Nepal. I would have beaten anyone for defaming me and my country, but as it was a policeman I didn't want any trouble during my travel with my mom. So, we decided to skip the plan of visiting Sarnath. Not only me and my mom were deprived of visiting Sarnath, but there were a few other foreign visitors from Sweden and France who faced the same problem.Even to enter the Sarnath museum there was an online system, we understand India wants to go fully digitalized. But on the monument's site, there should be the option of a ticket counter for foreign tourists who have issues buying tickets online. Tourists come to visit this beautiful country and monuments from all around the world but due to lack of access to buy the ticket they are deprived to enter the heritage sites and museums. One of the domestic tourists a young gentle guy (Arun Chauhan, who had come from Delhi) paid for our museum tickets, I appreciate his help though we couldn't visit Sarnath we could visit the Museum because of his generous act.",Nov-23, Family

It's a must visit place if one is visiting Varanasi....Online tickets have to be booked using their website or by scanning the QR Code available there....Take the help of the tour guides( under Government of India)... However,  they will ask you to pay huge amount... bargaining the rate is absolutely possible... They will take you all around the site and will impart the historical facts to the best of their knowledge.... Must visit the adjacent museum as well which houses the half of Ashokan pillars.... Side note(Warning)-However,  I must mention about the fraud that is committed some 200-300mtrs away from the main Sarnath site.... So if you hire some cabs or other private transport,  they are gonna drop you off near the Sarnath monastery (which was built by some Thai King about 100 yrs ago).... There you will meet some wannabe tour guides who will literally force you to hire them at a paltry sum of Rs 100-200... Then they will take you around the monastery premises and the temple and will give you some basic info available easily on the wikipedia.... And then on the pretext of showing how Banarasi Sarees are weaved,  they will take you to the backside of a shop and will literally force you to buy Sarees from them... All these happened before we got to see the main Sarnath site.... they were trying to dupe us... When we enquired them about the Stupas and all, that bloke even had the audacity to tell us that the real Sarnath is a wastage of time...Thanks to the owner of a tea stall outside the monastery.... He told us everything about these frauds and was kind enough to guide us to the real site....Such a pathetic experience... I hope government authorities will take strict actions against these fraudsters....Other than this, I had an amazing experience at the Sarnath....",Jul-23, Family
