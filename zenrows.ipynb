      "Review Body: The evening arati and the early morning boat ride were amazing. We took a boat, and the boatmen started the price from 5000 INR per boat but at last, made a deal for 3000 per boat later we found out 3000 for a small boat was an expensive deal. Anyway, we had no choice as there were no ticket counters for the boat we had to bargain no other choice. The sunrise view was not visible due to the thick fog/haze. We took a boat for 3000 and in 5 minutes or so, the fuel got finished in the middle and near collision with another boat, and had to wait for another 10-15 minutes (shouldn't they check the boat before seeking customers) till the boatmen came with the fuel for refilling. Overall it was not as good an experience as expected\n",

In the evening we boated up close the main cremation ground, and our guide explained to us everything that was going on.  We then went back to the area where they were doing the Ganga Aarti. that was also amazing to see. Then the next morning we got up really early to go back and see the people bathing in the river.  Our guide gave us a great explanation of what the river means to the Hindu people.  Also walking through the old town to get to the river was an experience in itself, not to be missed.\n",

But when you reach the river, the music, chanting and sights was a cultural extravagance . We got a boat, to see the sunrise and see the  rituals as you drift up and down the river.Sunrise was awesome. The pictures you take close to shore where the funeral pyres are something else, there were even stray dogs and cows amongst the activities. Once ashore against donâ€™t try and take photos too near the funeral pyres. But Indian locals and tourist seem to delight in foreigners being there and wave to you as you are on the river and shore.There is also the new wider walkway from/to the river and the golden temple, which is also worth seeing.A bucket list experience.\n",

Itâ€™s also a solemn experience to watch the evening Arti performed on the river bank . To avoid the crowds assembled on the banks , it is best to experience it from the upper deck of the Alaknanda cruise  ship .This is an air conditioned  vessel with a seating capacity of 60. Booking is to be done online in advance @ 900/- per person for the evening cruise. Very clean boat with clean bio toilets . They also serve complementary coffee & biscuits.\n",

Just being there is meditative, takes you very deep in thoughts. The ghats, the people and their stories just adds more charm. Highly recommend boat ride during sunrise\n",

      "Review Body: Ganga river is one of the most sacred rivers among Hindus in India. Ganga river originates from Gangotri in the north of India where it is named Bhagirathi after King Bhagirath who is known for bringing Ganga down on earth by worshipping and Ganga meets sea at Gangasagar near Kolkata in West Bengal. During this journey, it purifies millions of people who take bath in its holy water.Ganga flows through Varanasi as well and there are 84 ghats along side. People do take this wonderful opportunity to take bath in the holy water and purify them. An arti is peformed in the evening which is worth watching. We did a boat ride in the early morning to take a breathtaking view of Benaras ghats. The rates of boats are negotiable, for safety it is advisable to book through hotel and if you are in big group then you may take a boat directly.\n",
