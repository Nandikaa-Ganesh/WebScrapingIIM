We took a boat, and the boatmen started the price from 5000 INR per boat but at last, made a deal for 3000 per boat later we found out 3000 for a small boat was an expensive deal. Anyway, we had no choice as there were no ticket counters for the boat we had to bargain no other choice. The sunrise view was not visible due to the thick fog/haze. We took a boat for 3000 and in 5 minutes or so, the fuel got finished in the middle and near collision with another boat, and had to wait for another 10-15 minutes (shouldn't they check the boat before seeking customers) till the boatmen came with the fuel for refilling.

We had one of the bigger boats (2 decks) giving good views from higher up than many of the available boats.  The cruise was timed to see the worship beside the river that happens everyday at sunset.  The 15 minutes or so from the set off point to the ceremony area enabled you to see life beside the river from pilgrims bathing to the ceremation area.  Boat protocol is chaotic on the water as it is with cars on Indian roads.  Dozens, if not several hundred, boats converge to watch the ceremony from afloat and all crush together - an experience in itself.  Sunset, the River and ceremony all combine to make it an unforgettable experience.  I would recommend the larger boats with a top deck - although further away you maintain a good view at all times during the ceremony.  You will need plenty of insect spray - as the sun goes down so the insects emerge and without a good spray you will be bitten.",Apr 2023 , Couples

First of all, I am surprised that kashi being a place where mainly senior citizens visit,  does not have  a single ghat which is accessible by wheel chair.  The newest Ghat Ramghat has a ramp but was closed.  The boat dock is a good 60 to 70 steps down. Next thing the boat operator takes you for the 30 min ride parallel to the ghats with out caring to explain the importance or history of any of the ghat. Most boats are motor boats which is so noisy, it just spoils the serenity of the holy ganges. Near the end of the ride arnd 6.30 pm, the boat operator steers the boat near to the ghats where evening Ganga Aarti is being performed, There are already about a 100 other boats and many more coming next jostling for space. Our boat guy managed to find space and we were about 6 to 7 rows of boats from the ghats. Now there are 2 groups of people in the Ghats who are performing evening aarti in the ghats and we were in the middle, so we are like listening to aarti, dhol and the chanting from both sides which is not is sync and chaotic. Then there are vendors who are selling tea and water and what not jumping from boat to boat.  All in all not at all a pleasant experience  for me unlike as mentioned in other reviews.",Mar 2023,

As someone who was born and raised in Varanasi, I have a special connection to this river. The Ganges is not just a water source but also a source of life, culture, and spirituality for millions of people. The river is considered holy by Hindus and is used for religious rituals, bathing, and cremation ceremonies.Growing up in Varanasi, the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of the Ganges has surrounded me. I have witnessed the beautiful and colourful aartis (prayer ceremonies) performed in the evening, the peaceful boat rides down the river, and the bustling energy of the markets along the ghats. The Ganges is also a source of livelihood for many people in the region, including fishermen, flower sellers, boatmen, local photographers and many small businesses that rely on the river for their daily bread.In conclusion, the Ganges River is not just a body of water, but it is a symbol of India's rich cultural and spiritual heritage.

The rates of boats are negotiable, for safety it is advisable to book through hotel and if you are in big group then you may take a boat directly.",Feb 2020,
